# magic_8_ball

## The Main Goal

The main goal of this project is to solidify what was learned in the Dicee project. Basically, we're going to solidify the knowledge about differences between Stateless and Stateful Widgets.

## The App

The app represents a magic 8 ball, which is able to answer the most ricky questions in life! You just have to press the ball and take its answer for your question!
